# OpenCharityAuction

This is a program me and another person had coded for our children's school's Annual PTA Gala.
The program had been successfully used the last 2 years to manage and run the auction.
We had written it in Node, Express, Jade, and Web API.  

This program saved our school $3000 a year due to the cost of an out of box solution
which would have to be paid yearly.

I wanted to learn the new .Net core framework, and at the same time genericize the program
so that others could use it.

The program will allow the entire management  of the Auction Lifecycle, including:

<ul>
  <li>Setting up multiple events</li>
  <li>Setting up Admission Tickets</li>
  <li>Setting up Meals</li>
  <li>
Setting up Reserved Tables</li>
  <li>
Setting Up Bidders, who will be able to bid on or buy items</li>
  <li>
Printing Certificates for prizes that are not redeemed at the auction.</li>
